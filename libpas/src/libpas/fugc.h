               contents.
               
               But that would be wrong!
               
               Consider this race:
               
               0. GC hasn't started yet, but will do so soon. We're not marking.
               1. Mutator starts doing an atomic store. It doesn't run the barrier for the value
                  being stored, because we're not marking. Mutator doesn't yet get to the part where
                  it creates the atomic box.
               2. GC starts, sets marking to true.
               3. Mutator gets a bit further - now creates the atomic box, realizes that we're
                  marking, so it marks the box.

               Now we have a marked box with unmarked contents. Note that the box will be stored into
               an aux, or the box will get thrown away (can happen for ptr CAS). If it's thrown away,
               then it doesn't matter if it's marked or not, and it doesn't matter if its contents is
               marked or not.
               
               But if it's stored into the aux, then we'll find it here, and we'll see that it's
               marked already. And we need to mark whatever it points at even though the box is
               marked! */
